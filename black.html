<h1>black</h1>
  <p>Black, darkness and mystery, hold a significant place in the universe. Symbolizing so many things, especially fear and the unknown. Fearing the unknown is fundamental to human experience. &its crazy to think a color has the power to pull it rite out of us. We spend our lives looking for light, and for ways out of darkness. Never wanting to look too deep into an abyss. The unknown consistently triggers our fear, as it represents a lack of control and predictability. Many of us need for control. Thrive on routine and predictability, as this provides some sense of security. When confronted with uncertainty, our minds often fill the gaps, amplifying our anxiety. Representing the unknown, the hidden, and the feared, black is used to convey mystery and remind you of what you dont know. 

Our brains. Wired to react to uncertainty with caution. When faced with unfamiliar situations, the fear center triggers a fight-or-flight response, preparing the body to deal with potential threats. This reaction is cool and useful in dangerous situations, but it leads us to anxiety and stress in everyday life.

Being afraid to look deeper into those recesses of your darkness that hide from you and the world, dont get rid of them. It turns them against you. And makes it something else to run from.</p>
