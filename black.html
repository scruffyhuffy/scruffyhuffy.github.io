  <p><img class="image" src="dedend.jpeg" width="250px">Black, darkness and mystery, hold significant places in the universe. And being a symbol of so many things-- fear, the unknown, sorrow, sometimes nothing at all-- its hard not to wonder where that all comes from. Fearing or even just to be wary of what we dont know is fundamental to human experience. But still it's crazy to think something as simple as a color has the power to pull it out of us. But we spend our lives looking for light, and for ways out of darkness. Never wanting to look too deep into an abyss. The unknown constantly triggers our fear, as it represents a lack of control and predictability. Many of us need for control. Thrive on routine and predictability, as this provides some sense of security. When confronted with uncertainty, our minds often fill the gaps, amplifying our anxiety. Representing the unknown, the hidden, and the feared, black is used to convey mystery and remind you of what you dont know. Our brains. Wired to react to uncertainty with caution. When faced with unfamiliar situations, the fear center triggers a fight-or-flight response, preparing the body to deal with potential threats. <img class="image2" src="skul.jpeg" width="200px"> This reaction is cool and useful in dangerous situations, but it leads us to anxiety and stress in everyday life. Being afraid to look deeper into those recesses of your darkness that hide from you and that you hide from the world, dont get rid of them. It turns them against you. And makes you something else to run from.
